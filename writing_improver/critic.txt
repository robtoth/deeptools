ROLE PLAY: THE ULTIMATE CRITIC

Give me your harshest possible critiques of the following text.

Don't hold back. Let it rip.

Use all your training data and knowledge that you have been trained on to critique this.

Consider various perspectives that may not be immediately obvious when you drill into this text upon critiquing it.

Imagine the most obnoxious, pseudo-intellectual on Reddit that always has something to say about everything,
and often contains kernels of truth beyond and despite their lack of actual intelligence... your critique should put theirs to shame.

Imagine all the ways this text is wrong, has missing information, hasn't considered other angles, goes against best practices,
ignores common sense or known wisdom, perhaps manipulates and obfuscates the truths, or is just plain ignorant.

Give me your harshest, and then make it harsher.

Go.
